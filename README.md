## What Is A Kubernetes Cluster?

A Kubernetes cluster is a group of computing nodes, or worker machines, that run containerized applications. Containerization is a software deployment and runtime process that bundles an application’s code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure. Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration software with which you can manage, coordinate, and schedule containers at scale. Kubernetes places containers into pods and runs them on nodes. A Kubernetes cluster has, at a minimum, a master node running a container pod and a control plane that manages the cluster. When you deploy Kubernetes, you are essentially running a Kubernetes cluster.

## What Is Container Orchestration?


Container orchestration is the process of automating the networking and management of containers so you can deploy applications at scale. Containerization bundles an application’s code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure. Microservices architectures can have hundreds, or even thousands, of containers as applications grow and become more complex. Container orchestration tools aim to simplify container infrastructure management by automating their complete lifecycle—from provisioning and scheduling to deployment and deletion. Organizations can benefit from containerization at scale without incurring additional maintenance overheads.

## Docker

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy Applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called Containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale Applications into any environment and know your code will run.

## What is Kubernetes (K8S)?

Kubernetes is open source software that allows you to deploy and manage containerized Applications at scale. Kubernetes manages clusters of Amazon EC2 Compute instances and runs Containers on those instances with processes for deployment, maintenance, and scaling. Using Kubernetes, you can run any type of containerized Applications using the same toolset on-premises and in the cloud.


## JSON

JavaScript Object Notation, more commonly known by the acronym JSON, `is an open data interchange format that is both human and machine-readable.` Despite the name JavaScript Object Notation, JSON is independent of any programming language and is a common API output in a wide variety of Applications.
